# Cloudsave

This program copies the contents of a specific folder to another folder. For instance if you want to copy a local folder to a cloud-synced folder or vice versa. Like copying to and from OneDrive, Google Drive or similar services.
If the files you are trying to replace is newer than the files you are copying, the program will automatically abort the operation.
The reason I made this was because I was tired of manually copying save-games on a Steam game that didn't support Steam Cloud.

How to use: Replace the filepath you want to copy to and from in the file "filepaths.json", then launch main.py (or cloudsave.bat).

If you do not have Python installed you can install it through the Microsoft Store. Link: https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NCVDN91XZQP?ocid=pdpshare

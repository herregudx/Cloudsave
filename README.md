# Cloudsave

This program copies the conent of a spesific local folder to another folder which can be cloud synced. Like OneDrive, Google Drive or something else.
Replace the filepath you want to copy to and from in the file "filepaths.json".

I made this because I was tired of manually copying save-games on a Steam game that didn't support Steam Cloud.
